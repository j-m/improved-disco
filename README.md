# improved-disco
"Great repository names are short and memorable. Need inspiration? How about improved-disco." k. 

Idea:
Basically a game idea inspo generator

Huge database of games and their features, genres, whatnot
Program picks any two that share x amount of characteristics

E.g. 
Civilisation          Game of life
-2D, 3D               -2D
-Strategy             -Strategy
-Conquest             -Survival, Reproduction  
-Resource management  -Patterns

May give you the idea of Slay

And underneath both games there will be other games that share some characteristics


Must include big mashable button to randomise again and again and again
Cause lets face it, most of these will be pretty bad
No machine learning. Just pure luck :)
